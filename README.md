### Welcome ðŸ‘‹ !
I'm an Automation Engineer passionate about **_Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision and Data Science_**!

I'm also passionate about **_continuous learning_**, and I believe that's a must for every professional that works in any tech-related area!


I've been studying for a year now to specialize into those areas. My GitHub is currently    **ðŸ”­--> Under Construction <--ðŸ”­**,
I'm constantly updating to show some selected projects I've finished, and you can find the list here:

               ||[Machine Learning and Data Science]()||       ||[Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Assistannt]()||

These are some selected Hands-on Projects from specialization courses I'm taking, which are:
