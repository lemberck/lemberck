### Welcome ðŸ‘‹ !
I'm an Automation Engineer passionate about **_Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, NLP and Data Science_**!

I'm also passionate about **_continuous learning_**, and I believe that's a must for every professional that works in any tech-related area!


My GitHub is currently    **:construction:--> Under Construction <--:construction:**,
I'm constantly updating to show some selected projects I've finished, and you can find the list here:
