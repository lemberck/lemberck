### Welcome 👋 !
I'm an Automation Engineer passionate about **_Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision and Data Science_**!
I've been studying for a year now to specialize into those areas. My GitHub is currently    **🔭--> Under Construction <--🔭**,
I'm constantly updating to show some selected projects I've finished, and you can find the list right [[HERE]](https://github.com/lemberck/lemberck/blob/main/README.md#data-science-and-machine-learning-projects)

These are some selected Hands-on Projects from specialization courses I'm taking, which are:
